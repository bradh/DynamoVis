# DynamoVis

- Description and documentation will be available shortly.

If you'd like to clone the repository and compile from the source, make sure to have [Git Large File System](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed and enabled. Git-LFS is required for large `*.csv` files. If you don't want to install Git-LFS, you will need to clone the repository and manually download .csv files in `/config` and `/public-data`.

## Release 
Suppose you are not interested in setting up your IDE for compiling from the source. In that case, you can use the [pre-release JAR file (0.4.2-alpha.2) here](https://github.com/move-ucsb/DynamoVis/releases/download/v0.4.2-alpha/DynamoVis-0.4.2-alpha.2.zip). Zip file contains automated scripts to run the software on Windows (`run_windows.bat`) and Unix-based systems (`run_unix.sh`). Make sure to have Java 15 installed and set up in your system or user PATH. If script files don't work, you can run the jar file using `java -jar DynamoVis-0.4.2.2.jar`  

Feel free to browse/open [issues](https://github.com/move-ucsb/DynamoVis/issues) in case you encounter something wrong.

**Tested:**
- Java version 15.0.2
- Windows 10 / macOS Catalina - 10.15
